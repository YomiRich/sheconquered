      <p><em>Postpartum depression is linked to chemical, social, and psychological changes associated with having a baby. The term describes a range of physical and emotional changes that many new mothers experience. She conquered is a solution to this problem facing many mothers around the world. It is a world class platform that provides the millenial woman with the skills and facilities to help her overcome postnartal depression and also provide room for free counselling to enable each mother enjoy motherhood from conception, until the baby grows to 6 months old. She conquered provides inspiration through the stories of real women who have succeeded in overcoming postnatal depression,  while also highlighting the information and resources needed to achieve that success.  These resources include a special program designed by the founder-Yomi Rich, four proffessional counsellors available during mobile clinics, two Queens and two nurses. The goal is to empower women irregardless of how they got pregnant to enjoy motherhood, while at the same time, enabling them achieve their goals.  The professionals available during the mobile clinics on She conquered have the power to break the mold and illustrate to young women across Africa that there is no limit to what one can achieve.  Each of our featured women are the embodiment of 'I can do all things' motto within their own scope. The resources available to the members on the site can potentially put them in a position to better strategize and visualize life and career options without looking at motherhood as a barrier.</em></p>

      <P> The first contact a baby has when they are born is their mother. Everything they need to learn, they learn from home first. To have a responsible child, man or woman, changes have to begin from home. Because the mother has a very imporatant role in raising the child; It is very important to take care of her because, babies not only pick up on their mother’s stress, but they also show corresponding physiological changes, according to a UC San Francisco-led study.The research shows that infants ‘catch’ and embody the physiological residue of their mothers’ stressful experiences,says lead researcher Sara Waters, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the UCSF Department of Psychiatry.<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797613518352">Psycological Science</a></p>

      <p>Changing one mother is equal to changing one community. How much more can happen when you change 100? 1000? or hundrends of thousands?</p>
